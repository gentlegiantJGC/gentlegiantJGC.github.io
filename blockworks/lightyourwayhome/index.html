				<p class="paragraph">Microsoft commissioned us to create a selection of mini-games based around the theme of light and set in famous places in Los Angeles. This would be played live on a stream by some well-known youtubers. For every mini-game they completed a word would light up in game and on a real life structure in Los Angeles. This ultimately read out the phrase "Light Your Way Home" with a torch beside it.</p>

				<p class="paragraph">This project was used to launch the #minecraftIRL campaign that took elements from the game and brought them into real life. The playable map can be found on Minecraft Realms (the official server service)</p>
				<p class="paragraph">My part in this project was making the in-game cinematics which were created in Blender (a free animation program) and exported using a python script to commands that could be imported to the game. I also created one of the mini-games that consisted of a light beam being fired out in the direction you were facing that player could walk along.</p>
