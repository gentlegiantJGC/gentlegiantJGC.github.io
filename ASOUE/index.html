			    <p class="paragraph">
			        A Series of Unfortunate Events is a series of books that was adapted into a Netflix TV show. In the Netflix show there is a device known as a spyglass which is a telescope with a number of dials and intricate detailing.
			    </p>
			    <p class="paragraph">
			        I wanted to have a physical copy that was as screen accurate as possible but nothing official existed so I decided to design it myself in Solidworks with the intention to 3D print it.
			    </p>
			    <p class="paragraph">
			        First I had to go through all the episodes of the show to get as many references photos from as many angles as I could. Then I had to work out which symbols were used on each ring and in which order so that it would match the real prop.
			    </p>
			    <p class="paragraph">
			        The design process was also somewhat intertwined with the prototyping stage to ensure that the parts fit together with the required resistance based on the need.
			    </p>
			    <p class="paragraph">
			        Once finished the design consisted of four large rotating rings, three telescopic sections and a cap that opens. The spyglass is made of two halves which can screw together to make the whole spyglass. Below is a cross section view of the finished model.
			    </p>

			    <p class="paragraph">
			        When printed, painted, weathered, veneered and assembled it looks like the photos at the top of this page. When the first one was finished and I was satisfied with it I manufactured a number more and sold them online to those who also wanted a physical copy of the spyglass.
			    </p>
			    <p class="paragraph">
			        I also decided to make a couple of 3D animations in Blender showing off what moves on the spyglass and how the parts go together to assemble it. These can be seen below.
